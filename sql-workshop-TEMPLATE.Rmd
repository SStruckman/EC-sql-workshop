# Intro
First, some basic background information.

## Databases
A relational database is a collection of tabular data **tables** that are *related* to one another by common identifiers called **keys**. The relationships between tables represent actual relationships in real life, and they are only made digitally explicit when the data are stored in a relational database.

## SQL
**Structured Query Language:** (*pronounced like "sequel"*) most common language for manipulating data in relational databases and extracting specific information ("querying a database").

Many dialects with slightly different applications (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).

Most useful for large datasets, where keeping track of everything or loading the entire thing at once becomes difficult. 


## Why?
* 	*Organization/Management* - tables and pseudo-tidy format make data easier to work with
*	*Understanding Relationships* - structure relates data entities in a way that unites different types of data
*	*Storage Size* - minimal redundant info duplicated across tables
*    *Quality Control* - constraints allow further control over data that is valid in different tables and fields


# Standalone Software
For some applications and users, a point-and-click user interface is desired. Standalone desktop software exists to provide this. This is similar to Microsoft Access/Excel or server-based online portals and can be a useful educational tool, since we can easily visualize the database and it various components. 

Let's load some data and explore it using SQLite Studio!

## Exercise 1
Open the `dragons_simple.db` file using the SQLite Studio software. 
View the structure of and data within each table. 
Navigate to the SQL editor (Tools -> Open SQL Editor)

## Exercise 2 (work-along)
Now, let's learn some useful statements and syntax in the SQL language!

First, let's try a basic query to give us the species column of the dragons table from the database. 
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT species FROM dragons
```

Now let's get all the columns of the dragons table from the database. 
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM dragons
```

All rows for adult dragons
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM dragons WHERE age_class = 'Adult'
```

All rows where sex is missing data
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM dragons WHERE sex IS NULL
```

Now we'll use the morphometrics table for some practice with aggregating. Let's query the captures tables for the number of dragon captures at the MOA site. 
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM captures --gives total number in table
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT site, COUNT() FROM captures 
GROUP BY site --gives total number in table, grouped by site
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT site, COUNT() FROM captures 
GROUP BY site 
HAVING site = 'MOA' --gives total number in table, grouped by site, then filtered to just MOA
```

Join the dragon data to the captures, so we can query to see how many of each species were captured at MOA.
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT site,species,COUNT() FROM captures 
LEFT JOIN dragons ON captures.dragon_id=dragons.dragon_id 
GROUP BY site,species 
Having site = 'MOA' --gives total number in table, grouped by site and species
```

## Exercise 3 (independent)
For this exercise, I would like you to work together to construct a query that puts all this together. Your goal: calculate the average wingspan of "long" dragons (total body length >1000 cm) of each species. Hint: you will need to filter, join, and aggregate all together. 
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT species, AVG(wingspan_cm) FROM dragons
LEFT JOIN morphometrics ON dragons.dragon_id=morphometrics.dragon_id 
WHERE total_body_length_cm > 1000
GROUP BY species
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
dbDisconnect(con)
```


# Commandline Interface with R 
Since many of us will be analyzing our data in R anyway, it might be easier to work with the database right from within R rather than external software. We can do this by using the `DBI` and `RSQLite` packages. These two packages are much more powerful than we have time to discuss here. If you want to learn more, the [documentation](https://rsqlite.r-dbi.org/) is actually very good.


## Exercise 4 (work-along)

First, let's load the packages and establish a connection with our database! This does not *load* the entire database into R memory, just links to the database on your local disk.
```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

dragons_con = DBI::dbConnect()

#NOTE: don't forget to close the connection when you are done! It will stay open as long as the R session is running.
#close with DBI::dbDisconnect()
```

We can get a list of the tables in the database, or the columns in a table
```{r}
dbListTables()

dbListFields()
```

We can read a table from the database right into R's `data.frame` format
```{r}
dragons_df = dbReadTable()
```

... or execute queries in SQL syntax right within R by wrapping it in the `dbGetQuery()` function.
```{r}
dragons_query = dbGetQuery()
```

## Exercise 5 (independent)
For the last exercise, I would like you to try executing some queries and saving the results as `data.frame`s. Bonus points for making the queries more complex and/or using other R tools you are familiar with to work with the data once it is out of the datbase
```{r}
#my_df = dbGetQuery() #fill in your own!
```

## Exercise 6 (BONUS)
To dive a bit further, peruse the documentation for `DBI::dbConnect()` and `DBI::dbWriteTable()` and see if you can create your own SQL database from scratch from within R. (A good option is your data are already in .csv format for your individual tables)

Look back at the `.Rmd` for this workshop to see how to use SQL natively within RMarkdown rather than interfacing with `DBI`.

```{r, include=FALSE}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
